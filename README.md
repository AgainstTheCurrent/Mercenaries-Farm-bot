# Mercenaries-Farm-Bot for Hearthstone
```diff
Bot is on a development stage but it already works to do some "Tasks" and run low level bounties
```
## Purpose
The purpose of this bot is to automatically pass the levels to level up your heros, win somes coins and do some campfire tasks 

It started as a fork of (and a collaboration to) a previous project but after being the only dev and going with a different point of view, I decided to make a new project.

(the purpose of the previous project was to autogroup heroes to level them up to 30)

There is a branch main to use and a branch for dev with new features but not well tested.
