# Hearthstone-Mercenaries-game-bot
The main idea of  the bot is to automatically pass the levels and assemble components, 
simultaneously pumping all your mercenaries level 1 to 30 (so far, then to add)
So how does it work?
in fact, everything is based on the fact that the bot collects a team of 3 of your heroes of level 30, 
and then throws 1 level there, and since for pumping the unit does not have to participate in the battle, 
the bot just passes the location time and time again and shakes the rest of your mercenaries to level 30.

In plans
1. Finish Project
2. Add mode selection - collecting fragments/pumping heroes
3. write a graphical interface for this whole case
4. It is possible to expand the functionality originally conceived.
